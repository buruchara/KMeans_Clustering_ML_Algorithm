# KMeans_Clustering_ML_Algorithm
## Description
The code performs the following steps:

Imports the required libraries, including scikit-learn for K-Means clustering and matplotlib for data visualization.

1. Loads the input data from the provided CSV file (Mall_Customers.csv).

2. Preprocesses the data by one-hot encoding the 'Gender' column.

3. Extracts the relevant features from the data and creates a feature matrix.

4. Performs K-Means clustering with a specified number of clusters (3 in this case).

5. Predicts the cluster labels for the input data points.

6. Retrieves the centroid values for each cluster.

6. Visualizes the clusters and centroids using a scatter plot.
